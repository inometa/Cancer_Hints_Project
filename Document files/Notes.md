## May 16, 2024 (Zoom meeting)
Discussed our initial insights into data. Was difficult to work on as it is, so we need to figure out variables of interest. However, these variables will be determined by the questions we want to ask or are interested in finding their answers.

- Pankaj wrote some code to explore data (To be added to GitHub later).
- Pankaj also identified about 77 variables out of the 300+ variables that may be significant.
- Ikenna talked about the need to see the variable definitions in the codebook to ensure we are choosing the right variables.
- Priti emphasized the need to have a [literature] basis for our questions. Also encouraged looking for how use of (or access to) technology relates to cancer diagnosis.
- Our mentor has been added to our slack channel.
- Priti shared another literature that may help guide our questions
### Todos:
- Priti to add the one page writing on the Readme file (in GitHub) by the deadline of this weekend containing description of our data, identification of stakeholders, outlining KPIs (key performance indicators), tables, etc
- Pankaj to add his python notebook to GitHub.
- **Everyone**: Add possible questions to the GitHub.
- **Everyone**: work on identifying important variables.
- **Everyone**: Read the literatures Priti shared.

> **Next meeting**: _Monday, 5/20/2024 at 1pm Eastern time_.
