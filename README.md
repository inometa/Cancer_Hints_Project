# Background
In this project, we wish to apply the learnings from the boot camp to study real data collected by the National Cancer Institute, called the Health Information National Trends Survey or HINTS.
HINTS regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. HINTS data are used to monitor changes in the rapidly evolving fields of health communication and health information technology and to create more effective health communication strategies across different populations. Survey researchers are using the data to understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved ones. 

# Methodology- Tentative

In this study, we wish to use machine learning-based classification models to study cancer occurrence in the US population. We are still in the process of finalizing the feature/independent variables.

# Dataset
We will use survey data collected during the second cycle of HINTS 4 from October 2012 through January 2013. This includes responses collected from 3630 individuals living across multiple regions of the US. The sampling frame of addresses, provided by Marketing Systems Group (MSG), was grouped into three strata: 1) addresses in areas with high concentrations of minority population; 2) addresses in areas with low concentrations of minority population; 3) addresses located in counties comprising Central Appalachia regardless of minority population.

## Problem description-Tentative 
We wish to examine the relationship between the use of health information technology, such as the Internet and tablets, cancer-seeking behavior, and geographical location and the occurrence of cancer.

## Potential Stakeholders
Individuals suffering from cancer and their families, as well as cancer-free individuals. Results from the study can guide individuals suffering from cancer to better manage their health, as well as cancer-free individuals to engage in their health management by the use of health information technology. The results will also guide physicians and other healthcare providers.

## Key performance indicators 
Model performance will be evaluated by creating a confusion matrix, assessing its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and calculating the area under the received operating characteristic curve at various thresholds.

## Data analysis 
### Data cleaning


## Action items 
### Possible Questions and todos
- Descriptive Stat.
- Clean Data [Ikenna]
- Finalize research question
- Features selection techniques to perform 1) Binary Classification 2) Multi-Class Classification (maybe choosing a particular cancer of interest) [Pankaj]
- Unsupervised learning techniques such as kmeans etc... [Masato]
