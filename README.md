# Background
In this project we wish to apply the learnings from the bootcamp to study  real data collected by the National Cancer Institute called Health Information National Trends Survey or HINTS.
HINTS regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. HINTS data are used to monitor changes in the rapidly evolving fields of health communication and health information technology and to create more effective health communication strategies across different populations. Survey researchers are using the data to understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved ones. 

# Methodology- Tentative

In this study we wish to use machine learning based classification models to study occurence of cancer in the US popluation. We are still in the process of finalizing the feature/independent variables.

# Dataset
We will be using survey data collected during the second cycle of HINTS 4 from October 2012 through January 2013. This includes responses from 3630 individuals across  mutliple regions in the US.The sampling frame of addresses,provided by Marketing Systems Group (MSG), was grouped into three strata: 1) addresses in areas with high concentrations of minority population; 2) addresses in areas with low concentrations of minority population; 3) addresses located in counties comprising Central Appalachia regardless of minority population.
