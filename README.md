# Background
In this project we wish to apply the learnings from the bootcamp to study  real data collected by the National Cancer Institute called Health Information National Trends Survey or HINTS.
HINTS regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. HINTS data are used to monitor changes in the rapidly evolving fields of health communication and health information technology and to create more effective health communication strategies across different populations. Survey researchers are using the data to understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved ones. 

# Methodology- Tentative

In this study we wish to use machine learning based classification models to study occurence of cancer in the US popluation. We are still in the process of finalizing the feature/independent variables.

# Dataset
We will be using survey data collected during the second cycle of HINTS 4 from October 2012 through January 2013. This includes responses collected from 3630 individuals living across mutliple regions of the US.The sampling frame of addresses, provided by Marketing Systems Group (MSG), was grouped into three strata: 1) addresses in areas with high concentrations of minority population; 2) addresses in areas with low concentrations of minority population; 3) addresses located in counties comprising Central Appalachia regardless of minority population.

## Problem description-Tentative 
We wish to examine the realionship bewteen use of health information technology such as internet, tablet and cancer seeking behavior, and geograhical location on occurence of cancer.

## Potential Stakeholders
Individuals suffering from cancer and thier families, as well as cancer free individuals. Results from the study can guide individuals suffering from cancer to better manage their health, as well as cancer free individuals to engage in their health management by the use of health information technology. The results will also guide physicians and others health care providers.

## Key performane indicators 




## Action tools 
### Possible Questions and todos
- Descriptive Stat.
- Clean Data [Ikenna]
- Finalize research question
- Features selection techniques to perform 1) Binary Classification 2) Multi-Class Classification (maybe choosing a particular cancer of interest) [Pankaj]
- Unsupervised learning techniques such as kmeans etc... [Masato]
